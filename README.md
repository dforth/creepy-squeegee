[creepy-squeegee repository on GitHub](http://github.com/dforth/creepy-squeegee)

These examples are not meant to provide complete solutions. They only exist to illustrate a few key concepts.


## Primary Libraries Used

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/)
* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
* [pagedown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
* [code-prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify)
* [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository, or download zip
2. You must have npm installed. Run npm install from root directory.
3. If you have Sails installed globally you can run 'sails lift' from the root. Or, you can run 'npm start' from the root.
4. Use the interactive examples, mess with the code.
5. Remember to look at the [React tutorials](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html), they are very good.
